# Movie-Rating-Sites-Analysis-EDA

## Description
This project focuses on analyzing discrepancies in movie ratings across various platforms and understanding the relationship between true and displayed ratings. The primary goal was to investigate how ratings differ between movie rating websites, using both univariate and bivariate analysis to assess correlations between variables. Additionally, data visualizations, including KDE (Kernel Density Estimate) plots, pair plots, histograms, and clustermaps, were employed to uncover patterns, relationships, and potential rating variations across different sites. By merging data from different sources and conducting in-depth exploratory analysis, the project aimed to identify trends and offer insights into the factors influencing movie ratings.

## Features
- **Univariate & Bivariate Analysis:** Conducted to assess correlations between columns and inspect any missing values in the dataset, helping to establish relationships between individual variables and their interactions.
- **KDE & Pair Plots:** Devised to examine the relationship between the True Rating of a movie and the Displayed Rating on various platforms, allowing for the visualization of rating distributions and any discrepancies
- **Data Merging & Visualization:** Merged multiple dataframes to integrate information from different sources, followed by the creation of histograms and clustermaps to explore and visually compare variations in movie ratings across different websites.
- **Rating Variation Analysis:** Investigated discrepancies in ratings across platforms to understand the potential reasons behind differences in user and critic ratings, providing insights into movie rating trends across sites.
